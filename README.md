# Wave
Wave is a Python Discord bot project I created back in 2019-2020, using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## What do you use it for?
The bot features a lot of general-purpose, moderation and fun commands. As well as the ability to create and host giveaways (circa GiveawayBot)!

## How do I use it?
Currently you can only use this bot by self-hosting. This bot was created with Python 3.8.2. Run the `requirements.txt` file and you should be good to go. Don't forget to replace `client.run('YOUR TOKEN HERE')` with your bot's token!
